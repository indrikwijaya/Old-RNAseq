# Old-RNAseq

This repo contain scripts to run end-to-end RNAseq pipeline (from fastq to RPKM files). Most of the intermediate scripts here are created by my supervisor, [Dr. Huili Guo](https://www.hguolab.com) and were written in Python 2.7 which is no longer actively maintained.

Even though the scripts are outdated, they still yield similar results to outputs run on more recent RNAseq pipeline. A bash script utilizing more recent tools such as Bowtie2 and featureCount give similar output to the results generated from this old pipeline.
